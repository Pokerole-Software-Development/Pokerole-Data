    "Description": "They have built walls around themselves that make it hard for others to see what's inside. They just want to be accepted but tend to worry too much and be way too harsh on themselves. Their confidence is usually placed on a leader figure and this makes them eager to please but also terrified to fail. They need to learn to trust in their own capabilities to reach their full potential.",
