    "Description": "They have a big sense of responsibility and won't appreciate when others don't take things seriously. Stress is a constant in their lives, if they have a duty to fulfill they will not stop until it's finished, everything else is a useless distraction once they have a task. They might need a hand since have a hard time relaxing but if you want things done well they are the ones to look for.",
