- Sprite art for items were gathered from https://www.serebii.net/ and https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net

- Some of the 'items' in SRD item list are category names. No art was assigned for category entries.

- There are a number of items that exist only in the PokeRole system. For example items such as 'Gourmet Food Can' and 'Inflatable Boat' do not exist in an official capacity. These have been labelled as 'PKR' in the Status column of the Pokerole Item List Tracker, and do not have art assigned.

- I took some liberty Orbs and Seed from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, as many of these items don't have official art. I substituted art from other orbs and seeds with official art that currently don't exist in Pokerole 2.0.

- In the Gem item category, the Fairy Gem appears to be missing from the SRD item list.

- In the Memory item category, the Flying Memory appears to be missing from the SRD item list.

- The 'Babiri Cherry' item is incorrectly named. It should be 'Babiri Berry'. I named the relevant sprite 'SRD-babiri-berry'accordingly.
