    "Description": "They like to keep their distance and do everything on their own. They often feel it's up to them and nobody else to get things done and will take the burden of a responsibility that should be shared. Interacting with others is like a chore for them but being isolate also makes them feel misunderstood. They are hard to get close to but they can be trusted to do their best even if there's no one to guide them.",
