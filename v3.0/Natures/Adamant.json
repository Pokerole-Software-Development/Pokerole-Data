    "Description": "An indomitable will that won't falter. Those with Adamant nature are belligerent and impassive. Only the strong survive in this world, that's why power and strength are what they respect the most. You are either their equal or you're inferior. Working as a team does not fit them well. They believe everyone must carry their own weight and those who can't will be left behind. They also lash out when they feel threatened and rarely care for social norms.",
