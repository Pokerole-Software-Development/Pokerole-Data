    "Description": "Lax is an inconstant nature, those under it will do things whenever they feel like it.   Is not that they are lazy, they just don't see the need to waste energy on stuff that's not important for them yet. Since they don't care to fill anyone's expectations they rarely stress out about social norms, but they'll need a reason to keep motivated and an even better reason to be pro-active instead of indifferent.",
