    "Description": "When you are aware of your potential you don't need others to praise you for it. A modest nature knows the reward is the constant improvement of their abilities, not the acknowledging of others. They won't show off nor will they feel diminished when others display better capabilities. They'll do their best always and the only one who may judge the right or wrong of their ways is themselves.",
