    "Description": "Free spirits hungry for enjoyment and fun at the expense of others. They carry themselves with a light heart but you can also see a smug smirk on their faces. Playful, irreverent and agile of mind, they dislike routine and chores. They are the kind to circle around a problem as a head-on confrontation will stress them. They also want a little validation from others so they'll get attention as the pranksters of the group.",
