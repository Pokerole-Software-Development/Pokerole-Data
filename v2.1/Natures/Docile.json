    "Description": "Always with a courteous disposition, a Docile nature indicates that you put others before yourself. Those under this nature love to please and be of assistance to their companions and community. They're not big achievers and might lack initiative, but even if only one person appreciates their efforts they will feel accomplished. They make great teammates and will be the first to ask: \u201cHow may I be of service?\u201d",
