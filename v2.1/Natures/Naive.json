    "Description": "The world is full of wonder; there is always something new to discover and many others to befriend. A Naive nature is a curious and innocent nature, they easily trust others because they ignore the many dan- gers of the world. They still have a lot to learn but they take life as it comes. They rarely stress out due to the fact they still don't know there are many things to stress about. A friend's smile and a hand to take it's all they need.",
